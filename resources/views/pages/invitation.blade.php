		        <p>Have you ever owned an item that you use only a few times per year?</p>
				<p>Do you own an item that is just occupying space?</p>
				<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
				<p>Do you need an item for one-time use and don't want to buy it?</p>
				<p>Has this situation ever caused you to spend money you didn't want or need to spend at the time?</p>
				<p><strong>BorrowMe Is here for you!</strong></p>
				<p>BorrowMe is an&nbsp;<strong>online item borrowing and lending platform</strong>&nbsp;that creates a sharing economy for underused items. It allows both item&nbsp;borrowers and lenders to&nbsp;<strong>rent/lend stuff online</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>make passive income, save cash, save the Earth, and build a community of likeminded people.</p>
				<p>Share and monetize your unused possessions or acquire the tools you need to complete a task while protecting our beautiful environment!</p>
				<p>BorrowMe solves everyone's lending and renting needs.</p>
				<p>Don't be left behind.</p>
				<p>Benefits the Earth?</p>
				<p><strong>Yes!</strong></p>
				<p>The Earth is full of abundant, rarely used products because more things are produced than needed. The production and consumption of these items cause 1/8 of all the Earth's CO2 emissions.</p>
				<p>Be a part of something big.</p>
				<p>Optimize your use of items by sharing them, making money, solving tasks, connecting and building a community, and, of course, saving the Earth.</p>
				<p>One platform to make everyone happy!</p>
				<p>Let's join hands together to make the world a better place with BorrowMe.</p>
